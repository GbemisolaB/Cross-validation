# Cross-validation

Built a machine learning (ML) model, using cross validation to compare algorithm accuracy to between Decision Trees, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN). Based on the results from the cross validation, Random Forest Classifier had the best accuracy. To improve the accuracy scores, grid search was used to tune the hyperparameters. The project developed a Machine Learning (ML) classifier to predict breast cancer diagnosis.
